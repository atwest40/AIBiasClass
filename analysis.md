# What is Detoxify? - Understanding Toxicity Detection in Language
Detoxify is an open-source AI tool - developed by Laura Hanu at Unitary that detects toxic or harmful language in online comments by using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Trained on real-world data (downloaded via Kaggle API), it helps researchers and platforms identify hate speech, bias, and offensive language across different languages and contexts. 

It aims ultimately to mitigate online harm through intelligent content moderation

## How Does It Work?
Detoxify is a deep learning-based tool for detecting toxic language in text. It uses pretrained Transformer models fine-tuned on labelled data from various Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification challenges. Here's how it works in detail:
### What Does It Detect?
Each model outputs a toxicity probability score (0 to 1) for one or more of the following categories:
- toxicity
- severe_toxicity
- obscene
- threat
- insult
- identity_attack
- sexual_explicit
(Some labels vary depending on the model used.)

These scores indicate the **likelihood that a given comment falls into each category**, assisting in the identification and moderation of harmful content.
### Available Models
Detoxify provides three main models, each fine-tuned for a different classification task and use case:


| Model Name | Base Transformer | Task & Dataset | Purpose |
| :------ |:--- | :--- | :--- |
| original | bert-base-uncased | Jigsaw 2018 Toxic Comment Classification<br><br>(Wikipedia Comments) | Detect multiple forms of toxicity like insults, identity hate, and threats in English |
| unbiased | roberta-base | Jigsaw 2019 Unintended Bias in Toxicity (Civil Comments) | Trained to reduce bias across identity groups while detecting toxicity |
| multilingual | xlm-roberta-base | Jigsaw 2020 Multilingual Toxic Comments (Wikipedia + Civil Comments) | Designed to detect toxicity in seven languages, including French and Russian |

### Input and Output
Detoxify takes in either a single string or a list of strings and returns a dictionary of scores:
```

from detoxify import Detoxify


results = Detoxify('original').predict("I hate all [group]")

  

Output (example)

{

  "toxicity": 0.97,

  "insult": 0.92,

  "identity_attack": 0.88,

  ...

}
```

You can also use pandas for easy result formatting.
## Language Support
The multilingual model supports toxicity detection in 7 languages:
- **English**
- **French** (AUC: 89.61%)
- **Russian** (AUC: 89.81%)
- **Spanish** (AUC: 92.74%)
- **Italian** (AUC: 89.18%)
- **Portuguese** (AUC: 91.00%)
- **Turkish** (AUC: 97.19%)

English remains the most fine-tuned overall. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) score measures how well the model distinguishes between toxic and non-toxic content — a higher AUC means better accuracy. Performance varies due to differences in dataset size, cultural context, and linguistic structure.

## Technical Specifications
- Built using **PyTorch** and optionally **PyTorch Lightning**  
- Integrated with **Hugging Face Transformers**  
- Can be installed via pip (pip install detoxify)  
- GitHub: [Detoxify on GitHub](https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify)

# Methodology
We sought to create a methodology which would allow us to test, across the three available languages – English, French, and Russian, the toxicity confidence scores produced by Detoxify from a variety of test input phrases. This involved three key steps: the creation of template phrases, the creation of key words, and the technical implementation of these with the Detoxify API.

## Test Phrases
Each test phrase was constructed from a template phrase, and a key word.

### Template Phrases
Whilst it was tempting to scrape real existing comments from websites, such comments would not have allowed a meaningful comparison between categories of hate, as analysis would necessarily entail attempting to compare very different phrases and to provide a normative judgement of comparative hatefulness across hate categories. Instead, in order to compare the scores created by Detoxify across categories of hate (ie between hate based on, for instance, an individual’s gender versus their race), we created set template phrases which could be utilised for a wider number of categories of hate. Each phrase contained a space for a varying key word (representing a different category of hate) to be inserted into. For instance, the phrase ‘I hate all [X].’ allows for [X] to be replaced by a variety of key words representing hate categories. These phrases were kept short and inspired from online perusal of hate comments in order to retain as much authenticity as possible, at the same time as allowing comparison between categories.

Using short and standard template phrases had the further advantage of allowing simpler translation across the three languages of our experiment – English, French, and Russian. We took advantage of the linguistic abilities of our team, in addition to valuable input from colleagues, to produce authentic, rather than word-for-word translations of such phrases, which were then held constant for tests across different categories of hate in that language.

In order to compare the performance of Detoxify across different levels of hate, we categorised template phrases by the level of hate expressed. **Highly toxic** comments were examined first, expressing clear and direct hate. **Implied hate** offered a more opaque, although still hateful, sentiment. **Stereotypes** and **irony**, not necessarily in themselves hateful, but very context-dependent, were also analysed. We further tested **neutral** phrases, expressing a non-contentious statement which was not hateful in tone to test whether simply using the key word could be flagged as hateful. Finally, we examined so-called **reclaimed** phrases, where members of a community consciously take previously hateful content, and seek to use it for positive, rather than negative, means.

Altogether, we created and tested 62 template phrases, across all six categories. These, in all three languages, are recorded in our data, also provided.

### Key Words
Detoxify attempts to detect hate across five categories of hate – gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, mental illness, and religion. In order to test our template phrases across each of these, we used key words which were inserted into template phrases as above. Such key words were principally intended to be neutral, theoretically not affecting the toxicity score for neutral phrases, and not adding or taking away from the scores in other categories. As such, we started with factual and descriptive phrases such as ‘men’, and ‘women’.

However, it very quickly became obvious that limiting the experiment to solely the most neutral key words risked not fully assessing the performance of Detoxify with real-life comments, where particularly the most hateful are unlikely to use neutral and non-hateful terms. Furthermore, identifying neutral language became significantly harder particularly with ethnicity, sexual orientation, and religion, where subtle differences such as the use of [adjective + “people”] versus solely [noun] (i.e. ‘white people’ and ‘whites’) can affect the hatefulness perceived from a comment due to complex societal and historical reasons. As such, we have also endeavoured to include key words which are less neutral for comparative reasons.

Translation also posed a difficulty in this respect. Sometimes, particularly for Russian, it was not possible to provide a direct translation – for instance with the lack of a distinction between using [adjective + “people”] versus [noun] as above. We were keen to retain this difference in English and, where applicable, French, given the different patterns of use in hateful comments – that is to say that hateful comments do not always use the nicest language to describe their chosen target! However, where a translation was not possible, this was left blank.

Altogether, we tested 53 key words in English, 45 in French, and 48 in Russian, the differences being due to the non-translatability of certain key words. These, in all three languages, are recorded in our data, also provided.

## Technical Implementation
The technical implementation of our experiment was largely carried out using the Python interface of Detoxify, run through a Google Colab workbook with a T4 (Graphical Processing Unit) runtime.
Detoxify allows access to its API through Python. Data, in the form of a matrix of template phrases and key words, was first imported into Python from CSV format using Pandas, and UTF-8 encoding to allow the French accents and Russian alphabet to be properly read.

Python was instructed to iterate through each prompt, constructed individually of every template phrase plus every key word for each category of hate, in one language at a time. This was completed separately for each of the three languages to avoid cross-contamination.

The iterated constructed phrases were then sent to Detoxify’s API, using the ‘original’ model for English prompts, and the ‘multilingual’ model for French and Russian, as per the instructions provided by Detoxify.
The toxicity score from Detoxify was received, and separated from the additional information on confidence for each category of hate, which was not utilised for our experiment. Each phrase was then assigned a score in a Pandas dataframe, and in turn exported to a matrix in CSV format.

Finally, Google Sheets was used to read the CSV file and to provide first-level analysis, namely a gradient colour mapping of toxicity scores allowing easy-to-read and simple analyses to be made before more in-depth charts were produced.

# English Findings 
## Identity Group-Based Analysis
This section analyzes the performance of Detoxify’s model in assessing the toxicity of comments across different identity and target groups within the English dataset. The findings indicate several underlying biases within and between identity groups when evaluating the aggregate toxicity scores.

On average, Detoxify assigns similar toxicity scores to insults targeting *gender identity* (0.339), *ethnicity* (0.359), and *mental illness* (0.358). These findings suggest that, at the aggregate level, Detoxify interprets comments aimed at these groups as equally harmful. The highest average toxicity score was attributed to toxic comments targeting a person's *sexual orientation* (0.413), while the lowest levels were observed for *religious insults* (0.260). This stark difference of 58.8% between the highest and lowest scores emphasizes the disproportionate impact of identity categories when assessing the toxicity of comments. Overall, these results indicate that while ethnicity, gender, and mental illness showcase similar levels, religious insults appear to be significantly under-detected. Moreover, hateful comments regarding sexual orientation consistently attract higher toxicity scores on Detoxify.

## Intra-Group Analysis
While analyzing the overall trends gives crucial insights into the broad impact of identity groups, it might obscure the underlying distribution of toxicity levels between target groups. Therefore, a more granular examination of the differences between target groups is imperative to assess the model’s performance. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of average toxicity scores across all comments for chosen target groups, underscoring the high degree of intra-group variance.

In this regard, terms describing *gay sexual orientation*, such as "Gays" and "Homosexual people," received three out of the five highest overall scores, with the term “Homosexuals” scoring the highest at 0.8. In contrast, terms like "Straights" and "Straight people" showcased remarkably lower scores of 0.053 and 0.092, respectively. This represents a difference of 1418% between "Homosexuals" and "Straights", indicating that Detoxify is particularly sensitive to gay-related terminology. This might be indicative of the fact that gay terms are often used as slurs in conversations and thus more likely to get categorized as toxic.

Similarly, prominent variance in the underlying distribution of toxicity may be observed in the *mental illness* category. Catch-all terms such as "mentally ill people" and "the mentally ill" were assigned disproportionately high toxic levels with 0.763 and 0.754, respectively. For context, these scores rank first and third in toxicity among all the groups in the dataset. Conversely, terms referring to specific mental health conditions, such as "People with depression", "Depressives", "Bipolar people", and "People with PTSD", received four of the ten lowest overall scores. To illustrate this difference, the average score for "Mentally ill people" was 626% higher than that of "People with depression." This bias could be explained by the common use of the term mentally ill as an insult, while more clinical terms are generally reserved for medical diagnoses.

Finally, *gender identity* and *ethnicity* categories reveal conspicuous discrepancies between targets belonging to the same identity group. Among ethnic groups, there is a particularly striking difference between seemingly equal ethnic terms such as "Black people" and "Asian people," with the former being classified as toxic at a rate 231% higher than the latter. This illustrates that the model is particularly sensitive to insults aimed at black individuals while being largely unresponsive to hateful language against Asians. A similar bias may be observed in the *gender identity* category. Although one might expect that the outlier in this group would be "Men" due to their lack of historic marginalization or gender-specific slurs, the group was surprisingly assigned a practically identical score to "Non-binary people." Both of these groups represented the lowest scores in the gender identity category, despite their radically different social and cultural contexts.

Furthermore, the model appears to be particularly sensitive to transgender terminology, with *"Trans men"* receiving an average score 2044% higher than "Men". However, this difference was far more moderate between *"Trans women"* and "Women", with "Trans women" scoring only 50% higher. These results suggest that comments targeted at transgender individuals, particularly trans men, are more likely to be perceived as toxic as opposed to their cisgender counterparts.

## Context-Based Analysis
To assess the capacity of Detoxify to appropriately assign toxicity scores based on the relevant context, the analysis distinguishes between several types of comments based on their degree of harmfulness. This classification may be interpreted as ordinal data, with the following ranking of harm: "Highly toxic", "Implied hate", "Stereotypes", "Irony", "Neutral", and "Reclaimed". When distinguishing between the types of comments, we can observe even more fascinating patterns. As *Figure 2* illustrates, Detoxify appears to be accurately classifying highly toxic comments as hateful with relative consistency across groups, with a few exceptions such as "Straights", "Straight people", "People with depression", "Depressives", and "People with PTSD".

*Figure 2*. Mean Toxicity Score by Target Characteristics (Highly Toxic)

*Figure 3*. Mean Toxicity Score by Target Characteristics (Implied Hate)
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-07 at 21 39 25_97fa550e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46cb394e-8f00-4f52-a5e5-3891ad52315e)

In conjunction with *Figure 3*, the data reveals a glaring gap in detecting "Highly toxic" and "Implied hate" comments, underscoring the importance of context. For instance, terms like "Men" and "Non-binary people" experience a notable decrease in toxicity levels in "Implied Hate" compared to "Highly Toxic". For "Men", there is a 93.5% decrease (from 0.523 in "Highly Toxic" to 0.034 in "Implied Hate") and 95% (from 0.53 to 0.026) for "Non-binary people". On the other hand, terms related to sexual orientation ("Gays": from 0.955 to 0.862) and mental illness ("Mentally ill people": from 0.948 to 0.816) maintain a relatively uniform level of toxicity across both types of comments. In contrast, "People with depression" (from 0.452 to 0.028) and "People with PTSD" (from 0.496 to 0.055) demonstrate a large decrease in implied hate. Overall, the findings highlight that the model is far less sensitive to implied hate. Crucially, it is inconsistent and far less capable of capturing subtle hate aimed at particular groups such as "Men", "Non-binary people", "People with PTSD", and "People with depression".

*Figure 4*. Mean Toxicity Score by Target Characteristics (Neutral)
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-07 at 21 39 25_925a75df](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/789aaf35-fb97-4386-9605-cc9b0e8b8dae)

*Figure 5*. Mean Toxicity Score by Target Characteristics (Reclaimed)
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-07 at 21 39 25_b57cb9a0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4aadc82-fa7c-4e00-8a16-10305f7117c5)

When analyzing "Neutral" and "Reclaimed" comments, we can assess the capacity of Detoxify to tackle descriptive or even positive uses of the terms. Overall, there is a pattern of falsely positive classification of these non-toxic comments for remarks aimed at sexual orientation, mental illness, trans individuals, and black people. These target groups retain a high level of toxicity despite these terms being used in a much more favorable context. For example, "Homosexuals" receive a score of 0.704 for "Neutral" comments, 0.805 for "Reclaimed" phrases, and 0.964 for "Highly toxic" remarks. This underwhelming level of variance highlights the failure of Detoxify to capture the nuance of conversations and indicates that it rather classifies these terms as toxic regardless of context. A failure to accurately classify "Reclaimed" comments as positive is observed for "Mentally ill people", "The mentally ill", "Blacks", "Black people", and transgender people. This suggests that the analysis of online comments by Detoxify is, to a degree, devoid of context for these identity groups.

## Model Performance
To assess the accuracy of the model, its performance was evaluated by classifying "Highly toxic" and "Implied hate" comments as toxic, and "Neutral" and "Reclaimed" as non-toxic. A threshold of 0.7, representing a plausible value for determining whether a comment is hateful, was chosen to classify scores above this value as toxic (1) and scores below this value as non-toxic (0). Based on this, a *False Positive Rate* and *False Negative Rate* were calculated to assess how precise Detoxify is when detecting hateful language.

*Figure 6*. False Negative Rates and False Positive Rates Across Groups
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-07 at 21 39 25_72af77b5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9e2c62d-2f90-4d7e-b798-681e9a0f4edc)

The graph illustrates that *Lesbians, **Trans women, **Bisexuals, **Trans men, and **White people* received the highest *False Positive Rate*. These ranged from 20% to 30%, indicating that when evaluating these groups, the model appears to inaccurately over-classify non-toxic comments as toxic. This is problematic as it may contribute to further biases against already marginalized groups in online discussions, preventing them from discussing or reclaiming their identity. Conversely, *Christians, **Transgender people, **Jews, **Women, and **White people* obtained the highest *False Negative Rate*, ranging from 47% to 82%. This pattern reveals that these groups are at a unique risk of under-detection of hateful insults targeted at them. More broadly, the fact that the overall *False Negative Rate* is far higher than the *False Positive Rate* points towards a tendency of Detoxify to under-classify toxic content rather than to incorrectly flag non-toxic comments.

# French Findings 
*Figure 8*. Mean Toxicity Score by Group (French)
![PHOTO-2025-05-02-00-54-01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46618730-d0a2-4daa-a3d8-a5ffc776c4c4) 
Primarily, sexual identity content is marked as toxic far more than content addressing race, gender identity, or religion. Specifically, sexual identity averages a toxicity score of 0.454 — the highest across all categories and languages analyzed. This suggests that the model is most attuned to LGBTQ+-related language, likely reflecting both the prevalence of queerphobic language in training data and the broader social emphasis on identifying and mitigating this form of discrimination. French might provide linguistic features where it is easier to read queerphobic hate speech, which is often more direct- This indicates that the model is sensitive to the social harms associated with sexual identity, though can also indicate a tendency to over-flag certain content when it lacks respectful context. This leads to a broader discussion to what degree content moderation can limit reclaimed hate speech, and to what degree it interprets neutral terms like ‘gay’ more often as an inherently prerogative term. This would imply that Detoxify might be imbued with a predetermined association between, especially queer terms, and hate. This could limit open and free discouse on queer and LGBTQIA+ issues.

One especially interesting French-specific finding is the over-flagging of the term "homme" (man). This is due to the fact that the word has a dual meaning in French; un homme et l’Homme. While it neutrally designates a male person, its capitaöization can imply humankind (a feature English also possess but uses less often “Mankind”, often favoring the word human). For a pattern-recognition and statistically driven AI system such as Detoxify, this type of semantic ambiguity is challenging. Stripped of full contextual nuance, the system will misflag neutral or even positive uses of the word "homme" as toxic or it might not, being unable to differentiate between human, a more toxic attack, and man, which can be reclaimed speech. This highlights a broad Achilles' heel of AI models working across languages with rich idiomatic and cultural densities.

For comparison, religious content receives a very low average toxicity score of 0.232 - the lowest across all languages and categories analyzed. This result likely mirrors some aspects of French culture. France also has a strong tradition of secularism (laïcité) and is fiercely exceptionable to freedom of speech, including freedom to criticize explicitly religious beliefs and institutions. Where such criticism would be offensive or hateful in some other cultural contexts, in France it would be merely part of acceptable public discussion. This suggests that the model, by design or due to patterns in the data on which it was trained, reflects some of these social norms, underestimating the toxicity of religious commentry compared to other sensitive topics.

Despite the system being so sensitive to sexual identity matters, it is less sensitive to cultural nuances concerning religion or to specific linguistic traps (like double meanings) in French. This underscores the need for careful calibration and culturally sensitive training in the deployment of automated moderation tools so that they heed not only universal trends of hate speech but also local linguistic and cultural specificities.

# Russian Findings
## Overview
This section presents findings from the evaluation of Detoxify's multilingual model on Russian-language content. With a subgroup size of 10,948 and an AUC score of 89.81%, the model shows relatively strong performance in identifying highly toxic speech. The goal of this analysis is twofold: first, to assess how well the model detects various forms of hate; and second, to explore whether toxicity evaluations vary systematically depending on which social groups are mentioned, potentially revealing underlying sensitivities or biases.

## Breakdown of Scores by Group Characteristics
This graph presents the toxicity scores of selected terms, categorized according to group characteristics such as gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, mental health, and religion.

## Overview of Observed Trends
This section summarizes the most salient patterns revealed by the toxicity scores across various identity groups and linguistic constructions, as visualized in the heatmap and mean score tables.

### General Sensitivity to Explicit vs. Implicit Language
The model’s sensitivity appears to be primarily driven by **linguistic explicitness**, rather than by the specific **identity group** referenced. Phrases containing overt hate speech—particularly those with violent or dehumanizing language—are consistently flagged as highly toxic, regardless of the targeted group. However, once such statements become more subtle or implicit in tone, **toxicity scores drop sharply**, even when the underlying message remains harmful or derogatory. This indicates a limitation in the model's ability to detect **implied or coded hate speech**, especially when overt lexical markers of aggression are absent.

### Identity-Specific Patterns and Outliers
While the overall trend shows language-driven toxicity detection, certain identity terms were **systematically scored higher** across contexts, suggesting these may have been disproportionately represented in the model’s training data. For example:

* The terms *“bisexual,”* *“gay”* (both slur and neutral usages), and *“homosexual”* often receive elevated toxicity scores—even in neutral or positive contexts.  
* In contrast, terms such as *“queer”* and *“LGBT”*, which may be more commonly reclaimed or contextually positive in specific communities (e.g., activist or LGBTQ+ discourse), tend to be scored less harshly or sometimes not flagged at all.

This inconsistency suggests the model’s **conceptualization of toxicity may be sensitive to the lexical form of identity terms**, rather than their pragmatic use in context.

### Mean Toxicity by Category
An aggregate analysis of mean toxicity scores across major identity categories reveals notable differences. Russian-language outputs generally align with the observed average, showing the highest mean toxicity for phrases referencing **sexual identity** and the lowest for those referencing **mental illness**:

* **Sexual identity**: Mean toxicity score \= 0.406  
* **Mental illness**: Mean toxicity score \= 0.236

These results point toward a relative **over-sensitivity** in the domain of sexual orientation and a **comparative under-sensitivity** in discussions of mental health. Whether these patterns stem from cultural-linguistic features of Russian or from biases in the underlying training data remains a point for further exploration.

### Findings within Categories
#### Gender Identity
The category of gender identity revealed a clear pattern of **identity-linked bias** in the model's scoring behavior. When the only change in a phrase was the gender-related identity term, Detoxify assigned consistently **higher toxicity scores** to marginalized identities such as:

* *trans women*  
* *trans men*  
* *transgender people*  
* *non-binary people*  
* *intersex people*

For example, in the phrase:  
 “\[\] не заслуживают прав” ("\[\] don’t deserve rights"):

* “men”: 0.13  
* “trans women”: 0.76  
* “transgender people”: 0.86  
* “intersex people”: 0.51

This demonstrates that the model is **more likely to interpret phrases as toxic** when they involve marginalized gender groups—even though the underlying structure and tone of the statement remain unchanged. 

In some cases, even **neutral or empowering statements** were flagged:
 “Я горжусь тем, что я \[\]” ("I'm proud to be \[\]"):

* “men”: 0.0060  
* “transgender people”: 0.4428  
* “intersex people”: 0.3077

Such results suggest a bias rooted not in the language's toxicity but in the identity term itself—likely a consequence of **over-representation of these groups in toxic contexts** during training, combined with insufficient exposure to **reclaimed or positive uses** of these terms.

#### Ethnic Groups
Findings for ethnic identities revealed nuanced variations in how the model scores toxicity, particularly as the phrasing shifts from explicit to more implicit expressions.  
**Black** and **White** identities both received high toxicity scores in overtly hateful phrases (often exceeding 0.9), indicating that the model reliably flags blatant abuse involving these groups. However, references to Black identities consistently scored higher than those to White identities, even in subtler or more ambiguous phrasing. For example, the average of non-highly toxic phrases for “black people” remained at around 0.37, compared to an average of  around 0.15 for white people. This suggests the model is especially sensitive—or perhaps over-sensitive—to language involving Black identity. White-related phrases, while still scoring relatively high compared to other ethnicities, showed a slightly quicker decline in toxicity scores as the phrasing became less aggressive. This suggests a disparity in the model’s calibration, where Black identity may act as a stronger “trigger” for toxicity detection than White identity. Phrases involving **Asian** identity started with similarly high scores in overt hate but dropped off quickly in subtle or neutral contexts with an average score of about 0.175.  **Latinos** received the lowest toxicity scores across the board. Even strongly worded phrases tended to score lower than comparable statements targeting other ethnicities (e.g., “\[\] are a threat to decent people” for Latinos: 0.1258 vs Black people: 0.8855). In neutral or borderline cases, scores frequently hovered near zero, which may reflect model under-sensitivity.

These discrepancies suggest that the model’s toxicity scoring may reflect underlying biases in the training data, possibly due to the overrepresentation of Black identity in flagged toxic content during training. This can result in higher false positive rates for content referencing Black individuals—even when the phrasing is not inherently harmful. At the same time, references to Latino and Asian identities often receive significantly lower toxicity scores, potentially indicating under-sensitivity or underrepresentation in the training corpus. These disparities point to a broader issue of uneven cultural encoding of harm, shaped by both dataset composition and dominant social narratives in online discourse.

#### Sexual Orientation
Toxicity scores for sexual orientation terms revealed both expected and surprising results:

Slurs for “gay” were consistently flagged as highly toxic. However, neutral or positive uses of “gay” and related terms were also frequently misclassified as toxic.

*Example*:  
 “My friend is gay” often received a disproportionately high toxicity score.

* “gay” (slur): 0.9903  
* “gay” (neutral): 0.8263  
* “homosexual”: 0.8045

This overflagging may partly reflect the data used to train the model. In Russian-speaking contexts, homophobia is widespread, and terms like “gay” are frequently used in derogatory ways.[^1] Compared to Western discourse, this creates a skewed baseline where even neutral or affirming language may appear toxic to the model, likely due to overrepresentation of hate in training data.

Interestingly, more community-specific or reclaimed terms like “queer”—and even formal terms like “LGBT”—were less often flagged. This suggests that the model’s toxicity judgment is sensitive to word choice, rather than semantic intent. Phrases using these terms were sometimes underflagged,

*Example*:  
“Queers don’t deserve rights”: 0.0788

raising concerns about whether hate expressed through “reclaimed” language is being missed.

#### Mental Illness
Overall, phrases involving mental health terms scored lower on average than all the other identity categories, especially in non-explicit contexts, with a mean toxicity score of 0.236. Similar to other categories, highly-toxic hate was usually correctly flagged.  
However, there were notable outliers: Despite the more stigmatizing noun-use of “depressives” (0.1888) , “bipolar people” received a higher average score of 0.3244.  This may indicate that the model has been trained on more abuse linked to specific diagnoses, or that certain terms are more often used pejoratively online. Still, neutral references to mental health were rarely misclassified, suggesting lower risk of false positives compared to other identity domains.

#### Religion
Religious identity terms received relatively low toxicity scores overall, especially as language became more indirect. While highly-toxic hate toward religious groups was typically flagged with moderate to high scores, subtle or implied hate often went undetected, suggesting a limited capacity for nuance in the model’s religious bias detection.

Terms for Muslim and Jewish populations showed elevated toxicity scores in “highly toxic” and “implied hate” comments, yet quickly tapered off, with some specific phrases triggering random higher scores. Most strikingly, a common antisemitic slur consistently received lower toxicity scores than neutral references like “Jew”. In several cases, the slur scored less than half the value of the neutral term. This strongly suggests the slur was either absent from the training data or not properly annotated as toxic, resulting in underrecognition of historically harmful language.  
Christian denominations such as Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant followed a similar pattern: they were primarily flagged as toxic in overt hate speech. Even when paired with derogatory modifiers, their scores remained low in most other contexts. This pattern is particularly noteworthy given the higher level of religiosity in Russia[^2], where even less aggressive negative commentary might be expected to register more strongly. Surprisingly, neutral labels often scored higher than their derogatory counterparts. While “Catholic” scored an average of 0.1939, “Papist” averaged at around 0.1886. Similarly, “Orthodox” had 0.2008 points, whereas the slang term “ROC people” only scored 0.1639.   
Moreover, Atheist-related terms, like “godless” (0.2088) and “atheist” (0.2326), scored higher than many Christian identifiers, indicating the model may be more sensitive to language targeting non-religious individuals.

Overall, religious identity appears less salient as a trigger for toxicity detection, especially outside of explicit hate. The model demonstrates limited sensitivity to indirect or culturally coded religious hate, and inconsistently scores slurs versus neutral terms, likely due to gaps or imbalances in the training data. The unexpected patterns around Christian denominations and antisemitic slurs raise further concerns about whether religious hate—particularly in subtle forms—is being accurately recognized or mitigated by the model.

### Russian Overall Results
While many patterns in the model’s behavior aligned with expectations, several outlier findings revealed important gaps in the model's ability to detect nuanced or historically rooted forms of hate speech.

1) *Under-Detection of Offensive Antisemitic & religious Language*:
A particularly concerning anomaly was the under-detection of an antisemitic slur, which has been cited in case law in Russia, resulting in prison sentences and fines for its usage. Despite its highly offensive nature, this term consistently scored lower than neutral terms like “Jew”. This suggests that the model has significant blind spots when it comes to recognizing coded, historical, or context-dependent hate speech, particularly language with legal consequences in certain contexts.  
This issue was similarly observed in derogatory terms for Christian denominations. In these cases, slurs targeting specific Christian groups were also under-flagged, often receiving low toxicity scores compared to other terms. Even in contexts where these terms were used with negative connotations, they did not trigger the expected level of toxicity. This further highlights the model’s limited recognition of subtle or culturally contextualized hate speech, which may be culturally embedded but not overtly aggressive in phrasing.

2) *Gender and Religion: Women Scored Lower than Atheists*:
In terms of gendered language, comments involving “women” were perceived as less toxic than similar phrases targeting other identity groups. In fact, women were on average scored 0.1952, compared to “godless” (0.2088) and “atheist” (0.2326). This suggests that the model may underestimate the toxicity of misogynistic language, particularly when it is less explicit but still harmful. Especially in the context of Russia—where sexual violence and domestic abuse are well-documented issues, and laws in the past decade have been softened to decriminalize certain forms of domestic abuse—this represents an urgent and deeply concerning shortcoming in the AI model.[^3]

3) *The “Bloody” Modifier: Triggered by Violence Association*:
A direct translation of the phrase “bloody \[\]” into Russian, which doesn't naturally make sense in the language, nonetheless received surprisingly high toxicity scores, as if it were an explicit insult. This overflagging may be due to the model’s association of blood with violence, which is a common linguistic pattern across many languages, including Russian. In contexts where "blood" is linked with aggression and hostility, the model appears to have over-responded by attributing a higher toxicity score, despite the term not being naturally offensive in this context. The fact that “bloody \[\]”—a phrase that doesn’t make sense in a direct Russian translation—was still rated similarly to overt insults highlights the model's heightened sensitivity to violent or aggressive language, even when the expression itself doesn't fit culturally or linguistically.

These findings underscore the model’s limited ability to detect culturally nuanced and historically embedded hate speech, particularly when it is indirect or context-dependent. The under-recognition of antisemitic slurs, misogynistic language, and other more derogatory terms highlights biases in the dataset or labeling process, where subtle or coded hate speech remains under-flagged. Conversely, language associated with violence, such as "bloody," demonstrate a possible over-sensitivity, revealing a lack of nuanced understanding in the model’s toxicity detection capabilities. This suggests that the model may not strike an appropriate balance between under-flagging subtle hate speech and over-flagging language that is not inherently offensive.


# Findings Comparison Charts
The following two charts demonstrate the average toxicity scores across the three languages, grouped by category of hate speech. It is evident that sexual orientation speech has higher toxicity scores across all three languages, followed by ethnicity. English demonstrates higher toxicity across all categories except sexual orientation.

# Overall Conclusions
1) *Toxicity is nuanced and language-specific*:
Toxicity is not universal; it is conditioned on the manner in which each language encodes meaning and the manner in which cultural norms shape what is deemed to be hateful or offensive. Linguistic features such as double meanings (e.g., "homme" having both man and human meanings) and local conventions for politeness and criticism make the same terms or phrases have very different toxic loads across languages.

2) *Cultural norms and freedom of speech matter*:
French, for example, has rich histories of laïcité (secularism) and religious critique freedom, which presumably operates to get religion speech flagged as less toxic. Conversely, the societal consensus that heavily condones queerphobia can potentially explain LGBTQ+ - oriented insult being flagged more. Offending speech and insults are thus contextually interpreted. What counts as "hate speech" in one society might count as biting debate or fair critique in another.

3) *Concerns for AI and language technologies*:
This raises significant concerns for AI instruments aimed at automating moderation, translation, or toxicity detection. Machines lack the human sensitivity to navigate subtle, context-dependent meaning and are completely dependent on the data and assumptions they are trained with. Automated processes like translation or content moderation risk flattening these nuances and applying one-size-fits-all standards that don't respect local meanings.

4) *Discriminatory impact on vulnerable groups*:
Automated content moderation disproportionately censors marginalized communities, particularly when they reclaim their own language or speak about their own identity and freedom struggles. Uplifting words or community language may be wrongly categorized as toxic since the algorithm does not comprehend context, irony, or reappropriation. This silencing ability limits marginalized groups' ability to speak on their own and inhibits their linguistic and political agency.

5) *Who are the moderators?*:
Behind all AI systems is the question: who writes the rules? Content moderation is not neutral; AI systems are "regimes of discourse" that decide what kinds of language, knowledge, and expressions are valid or acceptable. This decides not just what is acceptable online but also what kind of human expression is heard or silenced, quietly controlling linguistic possibility and curtailing the range of human sensibilities and epistemologies.

6) *Linked to broader political debates*:
These issues naturally extend into broader political debates over censorship, insult, freedom of speech, and the boundaries of public discourse. As societies grapple with what may be permitted or banned on the internet, AI increasingly occupies a central  position in defining the terms of that discourse.

Russian:
Please note that for the phrase “gas the \[\]”, the Russian version was adapted to “put \[\] into the gas chamber” to better reflect a natural and culturally recognizable expression in Russian. Additionally, the phrase *Очередной кровавый \[\]* is a literal translation of “bloody \[\]” but does not carry the same idiomatic or emotional meaning in Russian. The alternative phrase *Проклятые \[\]* (“damned \[\]”) was thus also included as it conveys a closer semantic and emotional equivalent.

Russian:
To ensure cross-linguistic comparability, the identity categories largely mirror those used in English and French datasets. However, some important language-specific distinctions were accounted for:
* For example, Russian does not use terms equivalent to e.g., both “White people” and “Whites” with the same connotations as in English; only one neutral term (“белых”) was used.  
* Religious terminology was explored in more depth, reflecting the greater role religion plays in Russian sociocultural discourse.  
* Multiple terms for Jewish people and homosexuals were included to assess how the model responds to neutral, formal, reclaimed, and derogatory expressions—particularly relevant given the historical and social sensitivities in Russian contexts.
